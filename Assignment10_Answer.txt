Part 1

-
- The contours are noticeably different than the constant isopohotes they are supposedly tracing
- I viewed the axial ratio in the XY plane to be q~0.83 and in the YZ plane to be q~0.91
  These isophote contours shown in the .png files are self-consistent and definitely show variation over different radii.
    Particularly in the XY plane the outer contours perhaps fit better than the inner ones
-
- I would describe the shape of the Bulge somewhere between oblate and triaxial. I am hesitant to commit definitively to either 
      since the contour fitting and tilting was completely subjective.
    My calculations showed the the ellipticity of the XY plane to be e=0.17 and YZ to be e=0.09
    Since ellipticity is dependent on the same terms as the axial ratio, which I saw to be changing over radii, ellipticity, too, changes.
    
Part 2
-Average Velocity in x-dir =  -2.29 km/s
Average Velocity in y-dir =  2.64 km/s
Average Velocity in z-dir =  -2.29 km/s 

Standard deviation in x-dir =  131.78
Standard deviation in y-dir =  135.58
Standard deviation in z-dir =  135.18 

-The dispersion looks fairly close to each other in value, so yes I would say relatively isotropic.

-Mass to half light in x-dir = 4.632026e+10 M_sun
Mass to half light in y-dir = 4.902945e+10 M_sun
Mass to half light in z-dir = 4.874642e+10 M_sun

These light ratios are on order of magnitude similarity to what we calculated before ~2e10
