Part 1

- The contours are noticeably different than the constant isopohotes they are supposedly tracing
- I viewed the axial ratio in the XY plane to be q~0.83 and in the YZ plane to be q~0.91
  These isophote contours shown in the .png files are self-consistent and definitely show variation over different radii.
    Particularly in the XY plane the outer contours perhaps fit better than the inner ones
-
- I would describe the shape of the Bulge somewhere between oblate and triaxial. I am hesitant to commit definitively to either 
      since the contour fitting and tilting was completely subjective.
    My calculations showed the the ellipticity of the XY plane to be e=0.17 and YZ to be e=0.09
    Since ellipticity is dependent on the same terms as the axial ratio, which I saw to be changing over radii, ellipticity, too, changes.
